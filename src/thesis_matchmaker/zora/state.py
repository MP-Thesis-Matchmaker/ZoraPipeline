"""
Tracks the incremental harvest watermark, plus per-mode last-run
timestamps. Lives on local disk (config.STATE_PATH) rather than any
external store — whatever's hosting the harvester (a CI job, a
long-running scheduler process, anything) just needs this file to
persist on whatever disk it's given between runs.
