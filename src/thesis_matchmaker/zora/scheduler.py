"""
Deployment-agnostic scheduler for continuous operation.

This exists to answer a specific problem: a GitHub Actions cron can trigger
a harvest and push results to this git repo, but a deployed, running
application isn't a git repo — it can't refresh its own data that way.
The fix isn't a different CI trigger, it's moving "when do we harvest"
inside the application itself, as a long-running process, so it works
identically no matter what ends up hosting it — a bare VM, a plain Docker
container, a Kubernetes Pod, anything that can keep a process alive.

This module changes nothing about *how* harvesting works — it calls the
exact same harvest.run() used by the one-shot CLI. It only changes *what
wakes it up*: an internal loop instead of an external CI schedule.

Output still lands on local disk at config.DATA_DIR, exactly as before.
Where that disk physically lives (a Docker volume, a Kubernetes
PersistentVolumeClaim, a plain host directory) is an infrastructure
decision for whoever deploys this, deliberately left open here rather
than assumed.

Usage:
    python -m thesis_matchmaker.zora.scheduler
    (runs forever; SIGTERM/SIGINT stop it cleanly, finishing any harvest
    already in progress rather than killing it mid-write)

Configurable via env vars:
    INCREMENTAL_INTERVAL_HOURS (default 24)
    FULL_INTERVAL_HOURS        (default 168, i.e. weekly)
    POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS      (default 3600 — how often to check whether
                                 a run is due; this is a cheap check, not
                                 a harvest, so an hourly default is fine
                                 even for a daily/weekly schedule)
